### Procedure

1. **Enter the Differential Equation**
   - Type the first-order ODE in terms of y'.
   - Ensure that ‘x’ is used as the independent variable and ‘y’ as the dependent variable.

2. **Set Initial Conditions**
   - Provide the initial x value (x₀).
   - Enter the corresponding initial y value (y₀) at that point.
   - These values are essential to compute the power series coefficients.

3. **Configure Simulation Parameters**
   - Specify the desired range for x over which the solution will be plotted.
   - Select the number of terms to be used in the power series expansion (more terms = better accuracy).

4. **Run the Simulation**
   - Click the **Simulate** button.
   - The tool will compute the coefficients of the power series and generate the approximate ODE solution.

5. **View the Output**
   - Observe the series solution displayed textually on the right side of the interface.
   - Examine the plotted solution curve to visualize how the function behaves over the specified range.

6. **Analyze and Compare**
   - Check how the number of series terms affects accuracy and smoothness of the solution.
   - Try solving different ODEs from the given examples to compare solution characteristics.
   - Assess how the power series approximation performs near and away from the expansion point.
