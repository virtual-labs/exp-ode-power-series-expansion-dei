### About the Experiment  

This experiment explores the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using power series expansion methods, particularly Taylor’s series. The approach involves expanding the solution of the differential equation into a Taylor series about a given point and using successive derivatives of the function to approximate the solution at desired intervals. Students learn how this method provides a systematic and accurate way to approximate solutions, especially for initial value problems. The experiment also emphasizes the importance of truncation error, convergence of the series, and the comparison of Taylor’s method with other numerical techniques for solving ODEs.
